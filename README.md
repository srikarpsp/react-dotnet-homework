This is a simple application to manage your contacts. It's built using React, ASP.NET Core and SQL Server.

CLHbid.com will be using this application in our technical screening process. We'll ask you to make some changes to the
application and discuss them with you in the interview.

You'll need to start by following the steps in getting started, then you can move on to the homework section. More details, resources, and troubleshooting follow that.

If you have any issues, don't hesitate to email Mark for help!

## Getting Started

To start development, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the repository in a Codespace on GitHub, or setup a local environment with dotnet v8, SQL Server 2022, and node v20.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install` in the root directory and in `frontend`.
4. Run database migrations by running `npm run db:migrate` in the root directory.
5. Start the development server by running `npm run dev` in the root directory.
6. Run tests using `npm run test` in the frontend directory and `dotnet test` in the backend directory.

## Homework

Now that you've got the application up and running, it's time to make some changes! Make sure you've taken some time to
look over the app and have either a Codespace or local environment running before starting.

We'll be reviewing your work for:

- **Correctness** - Does the code do what it's supposed to? Does it consider edge cases and business constraints?
- **Readability** - Is the code easy to understand? Are decisions and key knowledge captured?
- **Maintainability** - Is the code easy to change?
- **Testability** - Is the code easy to test? Are the tests you added maintainable?
- **Collaboration** - Did you communicate well with others? Did you ask for help when you needed it? Did you use git, source code, and tests to communicate effectively?
- **Ownership** - Did you take ownership of the code? Did you make it better?

Below is a list of things to try in the app. We don't expect people to make it through all of them, so don't worry if
you don't get to the end. Please allow yourself **no more than 3 hours to implement the changes below** after you've got
your preferred development environment configured. We'll discuss your changes in the interview.

1. Get the app up and running and add a screenshot of the homepage to the [Welcome Section](#welcome) of this README.
2. Add the ability to create a new contact.
3. Add a new field (of your choosing) to the contact model and update the UI.
4. Add the ability to delete a contact.
5. Review the unit tests for the backend and make a change to improve them. Explain your choice in the commit message.
6. Consider the user experience of the app. Make a change to improve it and explain your choice in the commit message.
7. Imagine you're adding integrated tests using a tool like Cypress or Playwright. What would you test? What would you
   not test? Why? Add a new `npm run integrated-test` script to the frontend `package.json` file update this README
   explaining your choice and how to run the tests.

## Connecting to SQL Server

This development environment runs MS SQL Server 2022 in a container. You can find connection details in the `devcontainer.json` file. To connect to the database, you can use the following command:

```bash
sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -d ApplicationDB -P 'P@ssw0rd'
```

Learn more about the SQL Server container [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/quickstart-install-connect-ubuntu?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ubuntu2204#connect-locally).

## Trouble Shooting

### If you're unable to access the database
Make sure that you can connect to the database on the command line. If you can't try re-building your container using the VS Code command, "Codespaces: Rebuild Container".

If the database is available it's possible the migrations didn't run properly from the `postCreateCommand` in the `devcontainer.json` file. You can run the migrations manually by running the following commands:

```bash
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
dotnet ef database update
```

Happy coding!
